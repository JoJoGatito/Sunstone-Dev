# Supabase CORS Handling - 2025 Update Guide

## What's Changed in 2025

As of 2025, Supabase has made significant changes to how CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is handled:

1. **No Dashboard Settings**: There is no longer a UI dropdown or input field to set allowed origins in the Supabase dashboard.

2. **Automatic CORS Headers**: For REST API (PostgREST), Supabase now adds basic CORS headers automatically without requiring manual configuration.

3. **Simplified Implementation**: The new approach reduces configuration overhead but requires understanding how different use cases are handled.

## How Our Code Has Been Updated

We've made the following changes to adapt to Supabase's new CORS handling:

1. **Removed Manual Origin Header**: We no longer set the `Origin` header in requests as this conflicts with the browser's CORS handling.

2. **Eliminated Custom Headers**: We've removed non-standard headers that trigger preflight requests, as these might not be properly handled automatically.

3. **Enhanced Error Logging**: We've improved our debugging tools to specifically identify CORS issues related to the 2025 changes.

4. **Simpler Configuration**: We've simplified the Supabase client configuration to rely on Supabase's automatic CORS handling.

## When Supabase Automatic CORS Works

The automatic CORS handling generally works if:

- Your frontend domain is serving over HTTPS
- You send requests with standard headers (Content-Type, Authorization, etc.)
- You don't need to support credentials (withCredentials) or non-simple requests

## Troubleshooting CORS Issues

If you're experiencing CORS errors:

1. **Check Protocol**: Ensure your site is served over HTTPS, as this is required for Supabase automatic CORS to work correctly.

2. **Review Headers**: Avoid adding custom headers to requests, as these trigger preflight requests that might not be automatically handled.

3. **Use the Debug Tool**: Our enhanced `test-debug-supabase.html` page now provides detailed diagnostics for 2025 CORS issues.

4. **Browser Console**: Always check the browser console for detailed error messages related to CORS.

## Advanced Use Cases

For scenarios where automatic CORS handling isn't sufficient:

### Custom Domains or Wildcards

If you need more fine-grained CORS control (like custom headers or subdomain wildcards):

```javascript
// Option 1: Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel)
// This sits between your frontend and Supabase and can add CORS headers

// Option 2: Use edge middleware if your hosting platform supports it
// Example for Netlify or Vercel:
export function middleware(request) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS');
  return response;
}
```

### Edge Functions

For Supabase Edge Functions, you must manually set CORS headers in your response:

```javascript
// Example Edge Function with CORS headers
export async function handler(event, context) {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://yourdomain.com',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Success' })
  };
}
```

## Testing CORS Behavior

Use these methods to verify CORS behavior:

1. **Simple Request Test**: Check if standard requests work:
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/table?select=*', {
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'apikey': 'your-anon-key'
     }
   })
   ```

2. **cURL Test**: Test from the command line:
   ```bash
   curl -v -H "Origin: https://yourdomain.com" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "apikey: your-anon-key" \
     https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/table?select=*
   ```

3. **Browser Network Tab**: Examine the network requests in browser dev tools to see if preflight requests (OPTIONS) are succeeding.

## Conclusion

Supabase's new approach simplifies CORS handling for standard use cases but requires different strategies for advanced scenarios. By understanding these changes, you can avoid common pitfalls and ensure smooth cross-origin requests to your Supabase backend.
